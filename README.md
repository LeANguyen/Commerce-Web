- This is the Backend for the ReactJS version of my fist full stack project done in 2018 with just html + css + javascript.

  https://red-fashion-backend.herokuapp.com/
- There are mock frontend (html), but it is only for my school project back then.
- For the ReactJS app designed to use this backend, see: https://red-fashion.herokuapp.com/
